# Bangkit YOG-1 C Final Project
## Classifying COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 Lungs From CT Scan Using CNN

### 0. Dataset
What Dataset Did We Choose?  

We choose [COVID-19 Lung CT Scans](https://www.kaggle.com/luisblanche/covidct) dataset for our final project. This dataset is a collection of COVID-19 related papers from medRxiv, NEJM, JAMA, Lancet, etc. Total images in this collection is 746 CT scan images. It consists of 349 COVID positive images and 397 COVID negative images.

### 1. Reason
Why Did We Choose the Dataset?  

1. We choose COVID-19 CT scans dataset due to the current situation, COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.  
2. [COVID-19 Lung CT Scans](https://www.kaggle.com/luisblanche/covidct) is easy to understand and has some public kernels. Public kernels are useful to gain insight and compare our work with the others.  

### 2. Result
Baseline CNN Implementation  

### 3. Reason
Why Did We Choose the Specific Improvement?  


### 4. Result
Improvement
